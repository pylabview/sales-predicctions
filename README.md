# Data Science Sales Prediction

## Analyzing Product Types at Different Stores to Increase Sales 

Rodrigo Arguello-Serrano

This first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. This goal is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that are crucial in increasing sales. 

## Data Source: 

[Sales Prediction Data](https://github.com/pylabview/sales-predicctions/blob/main/sales_predictions.csv)

For this dataset, there were 8523 rows, 10 columns, and one Target feature.

## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
```
- Dataframe datatypes of each variable.
- Removing duplicates.
- Identify missing values.
- Define strategy to address missing values.
- Confirm that there are no missing values after addressing them.
- Find and fix any inconsistent categories of data.
```


> The Item Identifier will not offer good information for the prediction; this feature is like an ID with 1559 unique values. I am dropping this column.
> The Outlet_Size has 28.3% total missing values (8523/2410) and we don't have enough information to fill this feature, so we are dropping this column too

</p>


This histogram shows that the majority of the food items sales are around 2,181. There are some outliers items with sales > 6000.


 ### Expanatory Data Analysis

    - To visualize the data for explantory purposes, four bargraphs were chosen.
    - The bargraphs were chosen to show how the categories compare to each other. 
   


## Explanatory Visuals

</p>



The stores are bringing more Low Fat Items than Regular:
- Low Fat:    `5517`
- Regular:    `3006`

| Random Forest Trees | 767.8727   |  1219558.1845|1104.3361  | 0.5579673 |


- The Base Model performed the worst of all simulations
- The Linear Regression Model has good Variance with poor Bias
- The Decision, Ramdon Forest, and Bagged Tree Models have similar performance: High Variance with some Bias on the Testing R^2 scores


## Recommendations

>I recommend using the Random Forest, which has the best Testing Score (R^2) of `0.5946849`. This model still has some bias. However, this model performs best on the testing set with LOW Variance.
>Food Type, Retail Price, and Establishment Year indicated having more effect in the Stores sales

## Revisited: Importances and Coefficients
### Linear Regresion Summary
- What features made the model predict a higher price?
  >- Item_MRP

- Which feature made the model predict a lower price?
  >- Item_Weight, Item_Visibility
- What effect does having more visibility have on predicted price?
  >- Decreases home value by ~$220

### Random Forest Summary
- What features made the model predict a higher price?
>  - Item_MRP, Item_Visibility, Item_Weight
